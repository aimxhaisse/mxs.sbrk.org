I recently went through a problem with two PHP scripts in what at
first sight looked like a bug. Basically, I wanted a script _a.php_ to
update some `$_SESSION` values of another script _b.php_ using the same
session file.  As I didn't want to have a heavy dependance between
both scripts, I ended up using CURL, and calling _b.php_ from _a.php_:

```php
<?php
session_start();

if (($ch = curl_init("http://localhost/b.php"))) {
  foreach ($_COOKIE as $key => $value) {
     $cookie = $key . "=" . $value . "; path=/";
     curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIE, $cookie);
  }
  curl_exec($ch);
  curl_close($ch);
}

echo "My pokemon is " . $_SESSION['pokemon'] . "\n";
```

and:

```php
<?php

session_start();

$_SESSION['pokemon'] = 'pikachu';
```

Both scripts are hosted under the same domain and on the same host so
as to share session files. Guess what? It times out.

What actually happens is that the PHP process handling _a.php_ waits
for the process handling _b.php_ to finish (through the CURL
request). Both processes use the same session file, unfortunately,
between a `session_start()` call and a `session_destroy()` call
(implicitely made at the end of the execution of the script), the
session file is locked, leading here to a nice deadlock.
